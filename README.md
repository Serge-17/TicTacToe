Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe project! This is a simple implementation of the classic game, designed for both educational purposes and entertainment. Below is a detailed README.md file that outlines the project, its features, installation instructions, usage, and an overview of the code.

## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to get three of their marks in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the game with multiple modes.

## Features

- **Main Screen:**
  - Buttons for "Let's play," "How to play," and "Settings."
- **Select Game Screen:** Contains two buttons - "Single Player" and "Two Player."
  - The "Single Player" mode leads to the game screen against AI.
  - The "Two Player" mode leads to the game screen with a friend.
- **Game Page:**
  - Displays which player's turn it is (always X when playing against AI).
  - Shows a timer in the middle when playing against time.
  - Indicates whose turn it is above the game board.
  - Winning combinations are crossed out with a line.
  - In "Two Player" mode, you need to pass the phone to your friend for their turn.
